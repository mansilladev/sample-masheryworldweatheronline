SYNOPSIS
==================================================================
This demo App provides a way to see the World Weather Online API in action. 
It is built using Intel's Cross Platform Development Kit (XDK) 
that lets you create mobile apps for smartphones and tablets using
standard web languages (HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript).


WHAT DOES THIS APP DO?
==================================================================
This app uses World Weather Online's API to find local weather conditions given a city name or postal code.


GETTING STARTED
==================================================================
You will need the following to get started -

1. Intel's XDK. Free Download - http://xdk-software.intel.com/
2. A World Weather Online API key (Register at http://developer.worldweatheronline.com/member/register).


OBTAINING THE API KEY
==================================================================
Before you can begin using this app, you will need to get an API key 
from World Weather Online at http://developer.worldweatheronline.com/member/register. This will also 
give you a Single Sign-On Mashery ID with access to hundreds of other APIs. Choose the "Free API."


SETTING UP THE API KEY IN THIS APP
==================================================================
Once you have obtained your API key, assign the API key to the 
variable api_key on line 1 of the file api.js, like so -

```js
  var api_key ='PLACE-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE';
```
